# a3l6cGFk

## Inspiration
I wanted to have a macropad and I wanted to participate in a Hackclub event because I wish I discovered it earlier.

## Hardest Challenges Faced
I had to restart my PCB 3 separate times. So that was frustrating. I also don't full understand 3D-modelling so that's why my design is just a plate underneath the PCB.

## Other fun facts
The name a3l6cGFK is base64 for kyzpad. Kyz comes from my old clash of clans name that I converted to base64 to not look like something else. Which was not the intention when I used kyz, I just saw someone who raided me and changed my name to theirs.
